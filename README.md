## Contributing

### Writing code
To contribute to this project, choose an issue and assign yourself to it. Make a Pull request and put the `work in progress` label until you think your changes are ready to be merged. If you want to get help, add the `help wanted` label. Try to add all the labels that are relevant to your changes. You will be able to merge your branch once your code has been approved by someone else.

### Reviewing code
Since changes need to be approved before being merged, it's important to not only write code, but also review other people's code. A branch can be approved after the following is verified:
- The code is clear, even to someone new to the project (and if the code itself isn't clear, then there is a comment explaining everything).
- There is an approved issue related to the changes that will be completely or partly resolved by the code.
- The syntax is clear and is consistent with the rest of the project (project-wide syntax TBD).
- Nothing breaks with the changes made.
